- Angular is a frontend framework which you can use to build web applications and you can build single page applications.
- SPA (Single Page Application) gets downloaded by the browser once you visit the page and then changes are handled locally instead of well downloading the entire web application or website over and over again only because you are clicking a button or linke for example.
- In Angular, you create a single page application and when you host it and you visit that  application or any other user visits that application or website, then the browser downloads the entire application and handles the changes locally. So this really speeds up the overall user experience.
